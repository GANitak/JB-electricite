# JB-électricité
Building an electrician website, in Hugo, using toml for config, Netlify to deploy, and probably Grafana in the future.
Hugo theme is *up-business-theme* find it at "https://gitlab.com/writeonlyhugo/up-business-theme/"

Will tweak some of the theme though

## Status : 
...In progress...
**CAN'T DISPLAY ANYTHING** -_-' will probably redo the entire website, messed up the submodules don't understand how to read the content/post/... wtf is the headers out and why even the custom 404.html doesn't show

Q: How can I use Grafana to monitor once deployed?

Q: How to read the pages with this theme?

Q: Do I go back to use Docsy?

## Mission :
To help people find an awesome electrician
To help myself, by practicing web development
